Simulation of Health Time Series with Nonstationarity

Full Reproduction of Toye et al. (2024)

This repository provides a complete, modular implementation for replicating the paper:

“Simulation of Health Time Series with Nonstationarity” — Toye et al., 2024

It includes pipelines to simulate physiological time-series (glucose, EDA) under various distribution shifts, evaluate forecasting and classification performance, and benchmark against real datasets.
